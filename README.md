## micro:bit Reference Design

This repository stores the microbit Educational Foundation's reference design.

The purpose of this design is to help people turn the inventions they've made
with a micro:bit into a standalone board, and to learn more about how things
are made and manufactured.

Because of this, **it uses a module and isn't identical in size/shape to the BBC micro:bit**, but is instead designed for easy, low-cost fabrication, certification and ability to extend the design with hardware additions.

The full documentation for the reference design lives at
